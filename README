Configuration File (config.ini):
Purpose: Centralize configuration parameters to make the application more flexible and maintainable.

Parameters Included:

video_path: Path to the input video file.
output_path: Path for the processed output video.
db_name: Name of the database file.
scale_factor: Factor to reduce video frame size for processing efficiency.
skip_rate: Number of frames to skip during processing.
batch_size: Number of records to batch before inserting into the database.
log_file: Name of the log file for logging output.
Error Handling and Logging:
Logging Configuration: Set up logging at the beginning of pose_detection.py to capture events and errors. Logs are written to a file specified in config.ini.

Try-Except Blocks: Wrapped the main processing code in a try-except block to catch and log exceptions.

Logging Statements: Added logging statements at various points to record progress and important events.

Batch Database Inserts:
Batch Data Collection: Accumulated pose data in batch_data list.

Batch Size: Controlled by the batch_size parameter from config.ini.

Inserting Batches: Inserted data into the database when the batch size is reached or at the end of processing.

Database Abstraction Layer with SQLAlchemy:
Use of ORM: Replaced direct sqlite3 interactions with SQLAlchemy ORM for better abstraction and flexibility.

Model Definition: Defined a PoseData class representing the pose_data table.

Database Class: Created a Database class to handle database operations, including connecting, inserting data, and closing the session.

Error Handling in Database Operations: Added try-except blocks in database methods to handle and log exceptions.

Documentation:
Docstrings: Added docstrings to functions and classes to explain their purpose and usage.

Comments: Included comments throughout the code to clarify complex sections and logic.

5. Additional Recommendations Applied
Importing Necessary Modules: Added missing imports such as logging, configparser, and sys.

Performance Optimization:

Reduced Frame Size: Adjusted via scale_factor to improve processing speed.
Frame Skipping: Controlled via skip_rate to skip frames if necessary.
Flexible Configuration: By using config.ini, you can easily change parameters without modifying the code.

Exception Handling: Ensured that exceptions are logged and the program exits gracefully if critical errors occur.

Modularity and Reusability: Separated concerns by having pose_detection.py handle video processing and database.py handle database interactions.
